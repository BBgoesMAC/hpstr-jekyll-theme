Here we go! I decided to start with a nice blog. I will talk about current topics that I'm being confronted in my masters study, but also about things that I'm personally interested in. So the first challenge for me was to choose the "right" software. From wordpress to self coding, there are a lot of options. I installed wordpress, very easy, three clicks later my blog was online. Simple and effective. There are so many features and plugins for wordpress....Just unnecessary for me. I just want a simple, customizable, static web page with focus on the post itself.

Next on the list was Jekyll. Static, simple, customizable, posts are written in markdown which sounds pretty solid for me. No overhead, no php, no javascript. Increasing the security by decreasing the features. There are some themes out there which are nice looking. Lets give it a try. So I'm using jekyll for now. Pushing my changes to github is also pretty nice.

I will continue adding posts here in the near future. I will also update current posts. Do not worry =)
