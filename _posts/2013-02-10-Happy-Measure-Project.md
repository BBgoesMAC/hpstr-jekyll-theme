Last semester I applied for a project at the Quality & Usability Lab called Happy Measure. The goal of this project was to optimize the usability of an existing app. The app is about interacting with 3D objects using your smartphone and augmented reality. With Happy Measure and a marker the user is able to measure objects, move objects in your room, like a new couch, and directly see what it would look like in "reality". In general, I was responsible for the user interaction.

The journal article is available here:

And the app is published in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.tlabs.maren.furnishing.client2.android&hl=de">Google Play Store</a>.
