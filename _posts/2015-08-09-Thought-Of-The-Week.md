I was always wondering why the new TVs are designed with a curved display. I went to the IFA this year in Berlin, a huge exhibition with the focus on curved TVs this year, and all my questions suddenly found an answer.

Reasons for a curved TV:

- Less reflections, light travels past the viewer (see Fig. 1).

- Experiencing a wider field of view. As long as the viewer sits at a fixed position he can "see" more than he could possible see on a flat screen with the same dimensions.

- More sharpness at the edges. Curved TVs follow the natural shape of the eyeball. Images of a curved TV tend to be more sharper on the edges. This can be especially seen in an old theater. Old theoters tend to have really flat screens and because of the dimension of their screens, usually the corners seems to be a little blurry.

- More depth. Hey its a "3D" TV now. I mean the image is not 3D but it kind of feeld 3D. A curved TV has multiple depth planes, a physical foreground and background, just like a 3D image. This looks quite impressing to us.

- More contrast, richer colors, at least it looks like that. Due to the fact that the light gets blown out towars one center, the point where the viewer should be, all the color rays meet at this point and the viewer gets to see a maximum of contrast. Compared to a flat screen where the light rays also pass the user on the side, much more performance according to "using light" can be achieved (see Fig. 1 right).
